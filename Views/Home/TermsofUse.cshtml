                “Brainchild”, “we,” “us”) provide online classes, seminars, collaboration spaces, platforms, programs, products, tools, systems, services and other offerings through which among other things, users can learn, teach, develop, communicate,
                and connect (collectively, the “Service”).&nbsp;<br><br>You agree to these Terms whenever you visit, view, attend, use or access our Service, website <a href="http://Brainchildschool.com">Brainchildschool.com</a> and/or any Brainchild
                controlled websites, software, applications, functionalities, content, materials, or other online services provided by Brainchild School, whether partial, mobile, or otherwise.&nbsp;<br><br>You may express an interest in and, if admitted,
                sign up for a program using the Service. We do not promise admission to nor ongoing availability of any particular program, or warrant its content. We determine scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation policies and apply them at
                our discretion.<br>&zwj;<br>Brainchild School may change, suspend, or evolve any aspect of the Service over time or any feature of the Service, how the Service is delivered (in a particular app, software, or otherwise) or who may access
                it, without notice or liability. For example, we may condition access to our Service on good standing or compliance with these Terms and your agreements with us.<br><br>By using or accessing the Service, you (a) acknowledge that you
                have read and understand these Terms; (b) represent that you are at least 18 years of age and capable of agreeing to the Terms, or if you are under 18, that your parent or guardian has provided consent for you to access and use the
                Services; and (c) agree that you are legally bound by them. Your use of the Service is subject to your ongoing compliance with these Terms and any other written agreements between us.&nbsp;<br><br>These Terms incorporate our
                <a href="https://Brainchildschool.com/privacy-policy"><span class="link-underline">Privacy Policy</span></a><span> </span>and <a href="https://Brainchildschool.com/sms-terms-and-conditions" class="link-underline">SMS Terms and Conditions</a>,

                an updated version here. Your use of the Service is subject to the most current version of these Terms available at the time of your use. Your continued use of the Service after a change to these Terms constitutes your binding acceptance
                of them.<br><br><strong>Cancelation/Withdrawal. </strong>We are aligned for your success and support you, but we understand in some cases you may not be able to continue, and may want to withdraw from Brainchild School or otherwise
                stop using the Service.&nbsp;<br><br>For some programs, you may be responsible for a pro-rata portion of tuition under agreement(s) with us. These Terms do not relieve your responsibilities under those agreement(s), including for applicable
                amounts owed. We may determine that your material breach of these Terms means you are not in good standing as a student.<br><br><strong>Third Party Services.</strong> The Service may include links or access to third-party tools, websites,
                systems or applications such as messaging platforms, content systems, or webinar software. We use third-party software, applications, systems, tools and services to help us communicate with you and to provide the Service, including
